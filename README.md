# JavaScript Symbols Counter
## _A simple script to count the number of Javascript symbols are used in a project_
### User Guide:
- The script was tested and run using node version v14.17.6 with Widnows 10 OS.
- After this you need to run "npm install" in order to install all the requried dependencies which is a single package.
- You can run the file using node ./index.js or npm run start as I provided the run script for you.
- In the script, set the value of the base directory to one of your javascritp projects and then run to see the magic happens.

### About:
The script was created to know the most frequently used javascript symbols in order to create an efficient keyboard layout map using QMK firmware and tools for my keyboard.
